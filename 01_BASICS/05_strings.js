//the above concatenation process is valid but sometimes it become chaotic to write and understand and also gives unvalid outputs



// console.log(`my name is ${name}and my mobile number is ${mobileNo}`);
//the above type is called as string interpolation and it is good practice as well as make code more readable


const gameName = new String ("clash of clans")
console.log(gameName.charAt(7));//this charat method is used to print character available at given index no.
console.log(gameName[7]);//this also gives the same output as charat
console.log(gameName.charCodeAt(10));// String values returns an integer between 0 and 65535 representing the UTF-16 code unit at the given index.
console.log(gameName
